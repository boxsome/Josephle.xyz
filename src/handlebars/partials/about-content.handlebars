    <h1 class="about__meta__heading">About Me</h1>

    <h2 class="about__meta__subheading">
      I am a <span itemprop="jobTitle">visual designer</span> from <span itemprop="homeLocation workLocation">Toronto</span>. <span itemprop="description">I am an aspiring entrepreneur, storyteller,
      and pixel pusher</span>.
    </h2>

    <p class="about__meta__description">
      I graduated from <span itemprop="alumniof" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/CollegeOrUniversity"><span itemprop="name">OCAD University</span></span> with a <span itemprop="award">Bachelor's degree in Graphic Design</span>.
      During my time there, <span itemprop="description">I gained a strong appreciation and interest in all
      design-related things, particularly typography and UI/UX design</span>.
    </p>
    <p class="about__meta__description">
      A fundamental part of my process is to continually iterate until I can strike the
      perfect balance between functionality and aesthetics. Working through little
      micro details, especially at a pixel level, ensures that my designs can reach a
      level of quality that is both compelling, and engaging.
    </p>
    <p class="about__meta__description">
      My positive personality coupled with strong communication and organization skills
      have added value to all the projects I have been involved with. <span itemprop="description">I am always eager
      to experiment with new mediums and tools; consequently, this lets me analyze and tackle visual problems
      with unique and creative solutions</span>.
    </p>
    <p class="about__meta__description">
      <span itemprop="description">I am currently seeking a professional role where I can expand my skill set and
      explore new avenues to continuously innovate my craft</span>. I have the commitment and
      critical thinking skills to thrive in any environment. My strong work ethic,
      along with my skill set and passion, would make me a valuable asset to any team.
    </p>
    <p class="about__meta__description">
      When I am not working away at a desk, you will probably find me playing tennis or
      ultimate frisbee, exploring the city, fiddling with the latest technology, or
      staying up to date with media content so that I can make snappy pop culture
      references.
